Each game that you create will be stored in a project.  There is a browser in the launcher that shows your projects.  Projects are only loaded into the launcher if they have been opened in UE before.

There are (4) defaults that you can use to get started creating in UE4.
1. Games
2. Film, Television, and Live Events
3. Architecture, Engineering, and Construction
4. Automative, Product Design, and Manufacturing

After selecting the type, you can further select which kind of game you would like to create based on several other templates.

Once you select if you would like to use a template, the next page will allow you to select even more different options such as:

1. Blueprints vs. C++
2. Quality
3. Raytracing
4. Target Platform
5. Start Content
